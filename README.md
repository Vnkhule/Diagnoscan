Here is my Final Year Computer Engineering Project. 
AI based early detection of Chronic Diseases using Medical imaging.
This project broadly covers the modern health concerns of chronic diseases which are increasing on a huge scale due to change in lifestyle.
The various test reports such as CT Scan, MRIs, X-Rays, will get processed under medical imaging and results will be displayed on the basis of changed patterns of the affected areas in the body.
It will help common people to have a check on their health while following their daily routine and avoid any severe health issues.
